## 🛠️ Projects  
You can explore my projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ZamniProg):  

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - (git -> neuro)**  
   - Implemented a convolutional neural network from scratch without using third-party libraries (only **NumPy** and **Pillow**).  
   - This is my favorite project as it demonstrates my ability to independently develop complex architectures.  

2. **Basic Neural Network for MNIST - (git -> mnist)**  
   - Built a simple neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**.  
   - This project helped solidify my understanding of the core principles of neural networks.  

3. **Telegram Bots and Asynchronous Programming**  
   - Created several **Telegram bots** using the **Telethon library**.  
   - Gained experience in **asynchronous programming** and **multithreading** in Python.  

4. **Flower Classification Neural Network - (git -> neuro)**  
   - Designed a neural network for **flower classification** without using third-party machine learning libraries.  

5. **Game Development in Unity**  
   - Currently developing a **3D pixel art-style game** inspired by **1990s Japan** and **dark fantasy**. This game is currently under development.
   - Acquired basic skills in **3D modeling** and **UV mapping**.
